# Postgres Data Analytics AI Agent
*The way we interact with our data is changing*

## Setup
- poetry install
- cp .env.example .env
- fill out .env
- poetry run start --prompt "<ask your agent a question about your postgres database>"

## Why is this important?
- This is important because it allows us to create a more accurate model of the world.
- We become orchestrators enabling less engineering level and more product level work.

## Pros
- Can assign functions & prompts to specific agents, enabling specialization yielding better results.
- Agents can reflect on results to provide feedback thus improving the results.
- Can role play real organizational structures, existing and new.

## Cons
- It's an art to get the roles right. How many do you need? What are they? How do you know?
- Can get expensive in testing and scales with # of agents. The more agents the more expensive each query is.
- Can be difficult to debug why a multi-agent system is not working as expected.
